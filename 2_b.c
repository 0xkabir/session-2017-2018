// in line 6, capital S is used in Scanf, bu scanf starts with an samll s. Inside scanf, " is closed with ', but " should be closed only with ". float type is used to take the input of n, but n is declaed as an ineger. again & is not used to take input.
// in line 7, the value of Sum is declared as summation of sum and n, but type of Sum is not declared previously. after the statement, : is used, but and statement should end with ;
// in line 8, the value of sum is printed, but no %d is used in the line. %d must be included to print an integer value.
